#KOS Multiplayer

An Asynchronous, Asymmetrical, multiplayer, Dungeon Crawl.
------

A game will consist of atmost 6 players or bots in rounds of 1 V n-1 hunt, concluding in a final battle.

The "hunters" will work together to corner their enemy before they are able to gather some number of objects. 
To do this, they will need to fight through hostile mob spawns, mutable terrain and some-what trustworthy NPCs.
As they adventure, they will pick up money, equipment, and items and gain experience to combat an ever progressing enemy.

Play will be divided into "movements", each divided into some number to "turns" proportional to the distance of the nearest player. 
Turns can be used to bargain, attack or defend, use skills or move.
They will need to be entered before some time frame, and executed in the order they were recieved.
